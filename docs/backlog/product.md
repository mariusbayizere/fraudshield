# Product backlog

Owner direction (2026-09-17): from the M1 database work on, reviews fix BLOCKER and MAJOR findings
(security, data integrity, RLS isolation, append-only guarantees, audit hash chain) in place. MINOR and
NIT findings, and backlog candidates raised by re-checks, are logged here instead of starting
fix-and-re-review rounds. Governance-tooling items stay in `governance.md`.

Format: ID · title · source · priority · due · problem · acceptance.

---

### PB-1 · Test rejecting and confirming a folded tightening
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-1 (mutation M11 survived) · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** M2
- **Problem:** rejecting a folded tightening is not tested for restoring the true baseline, and
  confirming it is not tested for keeping both tightenings. The implementation is correct today.
- **Acceptance:** the fold test has a rejection branch asserting the defaults are restored and a
  confirmation branch asserting both tightenings stay; mutation M11 is caught.

### PB-2 · Document `previous` of a folded configuration change
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-2 · **Priority:** low · **Due:** M2
- **Problem:** for a folded change `previous` is the earlier baseline, not the settings at
  `base_version`; the javadoc of `ConfigChange.previous` and the OpenAPI property do not say so.
- **Acceptance:** javadoc and OpenAPI descriptions state it.

### PB-3 · Link superseded configuration changes to their successor
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-3 · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** M2 (with the audit writer)
- **Problem:** neither the `SUPERSEDED` audit event nor `ConfigChange` names the superseding change.
- **Acceptance:** `superseded_by` in the domain, the contract, `config_changes` and the audit event.

### PB-4 · State the consequences of folding in ADR 0014
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-4 · **Priority:** low · **Due:** M2
- **Problem:** ADR 0014 §3 does not say that chained small tightenings keep an unconfirmed tightening
  in force indefinitely, or that the first officer may confirm a change that folds their own.
- **Acceptance:** ADR 0014 states both; decide on an alert or a cap for chained folds.

### PB-5 · Complete `DOMAIN_OPERATIONS` in the authorisation matrix test
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-5 (NIT) · **Priority:** low · **Due:** next change to the test
- **Problem:** refusal-to-operation coverage is partial (for example `ROLE_NOT_PERMITTED` omits
  `rejectConfigChange` and `proposeCircuitBreakerChange`).
- **Acceptance:** every operation that can raise a refusal is listed.

### PB-6 · Licence inventory for container images
- **Source:** ADR 0018 · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** M9 (deployment)
- **Problem:** the ADR 0009 inventory covers library dependencies only; the TimescaleDB image (TSL) is
  recorded only in ADR 0018.
- **Acceptance:** every Compose and deployment image is listed with its licence and policy status.

### PB-7 · Compliance access to `v_auto_block_status`
- **Source:** M1 database review (MINOR) · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** M2
- **Problem:** the view is granted to `fs_compliance_ro`, but querying it fails because the role has no
  SELECT on `customer_verifications` and `customer_notifications`.
- **Acceptance:** grant the needed columns or drop the grant; a test queries the view as the role.

### PB-8 · Verification expiry must use the database clock
- **Source:** M1 database review (MINOR) · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** M6 (verification page)
- **Problem:** the `customer_verification_responses` expiry trigger trusts the caller's `responded_at`.
- **Acceptance:** the trigger compares `expires_at` with `now()`; test with a backdated `responded_at`.

### PB-9 · Role passwords off process arguments in the Compose scripts
- **Source:** M1 database review (MINOR) · **Priority:** low · **Due:** M9
- **Problem:** `20-fraudshield-roles.sh` passes passwords as `psql --set` arguments, and
  `check-seeded-stack.sh` passes `PGPASSWORD` through `docker compose exec -e`; both are visible in
  process listings while they run (local development stack only).
- **Acceptance:** passwords reach psql through the environment or stdin only.

### PB-10 · Commit/undo exclusivity under REPEATABLE READ
- **Source:** M1 database review (MINOR) · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** M6 (decision engine)
- **Problem:** `forbid_commit_and_undo` is exclusive only under READ COMMITTED; under REPEATABLE READ
  the check after the advisory lock uses the old snapshot.
- **Acceptance:** document the required isolation level and test it, or model commit and undo as one
  outcome row keyed on `decision_id`.

### PB-11 · Only the anchoring job writes `audit_anchors`
- **Source:** M1 database review (MINOR) · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** audit service milestone
- **Problem:** `fs_app` can insert anchors for future dates and so block the signing job (a forged
  anchor would fail signature verification).
- **Acceptance:** a dedicated role for the anchoring job; `fs_app` has no INSERT on `audit_anchors`.

### PB-12 · Distinguish SQL NULL from JSON null in the audit row hash
- **Source:** M1 database review (NIT) · **Priority:** low · **Due:** before the first audit writer (M2)
- **Problem:** `audit_row_hash` hashes `before_value`/`after_value` SQL NULL and JSON `null` alike.
- **Acceptance:** the canonical form tags NULL; a test changes one into the other and verification
  reports the row.

### PB-13 · Column grant for `customer_verification_responses.ip_address`
- **Source:** M1 database review (NIT) · **Priority:** low · **Due:** M6
- **Problem:** `fs_app_readonly` can read customers' IP addresses (personal data).
- **Acceptance:** column grants without `ip_address`, covered by the credential-material test.

### PB-14 · Existence probing through global foreign keys to `users`
- **Source:** M1 database review (NIT) · **Priority:** low · **Due:** M5 (retraining)
- **Problem:** `training_datasets.uploaded_by` and `retraining_jobs.requested_by` reference `users (id)`
  globally, so a writer can learn whether a user id exists in another institution.
- **Acceptance:** reference through an operator table or validate the actor in the service; decision
  recorded in ADR 0017.
