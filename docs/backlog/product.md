# Product backlog

Owner direction (2026-09-17): from the M1 database work on, reviews fix BLOCKER and MAJOR findings
(security, data integrity, RLS isolation, append-only guarantees, audit hash chain) in place. MINOR and
NIT findings, and backlog candidates raised by re-checks, are logged here instead of starting
fix-and-re-review rounds. Governance-tooling items stay in `governance.md`.

Format: ID · title · source · priority · due · problem · acceptance.

---

### PB-1 · Test rejecting and confirming a folded tightening
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-1 (mutation M11 survived) · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** M2
- **Problem:** rejecting a folded tightening is not tested for restoring the true baseline, and
  confirming it is not tested for keeping both tightenings. The implementation is correct today.
- **Acceptance:** the fold test has a rejection branch asserting the defaults are restored and a
  confirmation branch asserting both tightenings stay; mutation M11 is caught.

### PB-2 · Document `previous` of a folded configuration change
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-2 · **Priority:** low · **Due:** M2
- **Problem:** for a folded change `previous` is the earlier baseline, not the settings at
  `base_version`; the javadoc of `ConfigChange.previous` and the OpenAPI property do not say so.
- **Acceptance:** javadoc and OpenAPI descriptions state it.

### PB-3 · Link superseded configuration changes to their successor
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-3 · **Priority:** medium · **Due:** M2 (with the audit writer)
- **Problem:** neither the `SUPERSEDED` audit event nor `ConfigChange` names the superseding change.
- **Acceptance:** `superseded_by` in the domain, the contract, `config_changes` and the audit event.

### PB-4 · State the consequences of folding in ADR 0014
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-4 · **Priority:** low · **Due:** M2
- **Problem:** ADR 0014 §3 does not say that chained small tightenings keep an unconfirmed tightening
  in force indefinitely, or that the first officer may confirm a change that folds their own.
- **Acceptance:** ADR 0014 states both; decide on an alert or a cap for chained folds.

### PB-5 · Complete `DOMAIN_OPERATIONS` in the authorisation matrix test
- **Source:** contracts-events final re-check B-5 (NIT) · **Priority:** low · **Due:** next change to the test
- **Problem:** refusal-to-operation coverage is partial (for example `ROLE_NOT_PERMITTED` omits
  `rejectConfigChange` and `proposeCircuitBreakerChange`).
- **Acceptance:** every operation that can raise a refusal is listed.
